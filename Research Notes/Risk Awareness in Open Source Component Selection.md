## Research Questions

- What are OSS adoption risks?
- How to rank OSS project using a risk-aware selection process? What is that process?

## Brief Summary

In this work, a systematic literature review has been conducted to get a comprehensive view on existing risks in OSS vs. COTS components adoption, and to derive measures for analysis. They have stated out the differences between COTS and OSS in organisational context, development process, the motivation and objectives of the participating community members, and publicity of data.

Based on the results of the SLR, they have proposed a graph-based risk assessment approach to rank candidate OS components based on OSS adoptions risks.

## Findings

-  Presented a survey on the available literature in open source software (OSS) components adoption.
-  A comparison of the different supported back-ends
  
## Suggested Future Work

- Apply the proposed method on the complete set of risks, with measures obtained from ongoing statistical analyses of OSS repositories.
- More research is ongoing in the next two years within the EU FP7 project RISCOSS, to build a trustable base of knowledge and specialized tools.
  
## Relevance to my work

Can be used in literature review of the second paper (and also thesis)
