## Research Questions

- What are the different modification paths of the domain model of Control Systems?
- What are the consequences of the changes applied to the domain model of Control Systems towards requirements modelling and the identification of projects with similar requirements?

## Brief Summary

The paper intend to devise a systematic and automated methodologies to analyze software requirements that requires less input from user comparing with current workarounds. 

For this purpose, It has explained what Ontology is, it's usage in software engineering and the two views of it: Dynamic and Static Ontologies. These two types of ontologies are used in the paper to fill semantic causality table for for each state of the generated dynamic ontology from software system.

Having used a fleet management system as a case study, the paper has defined the below concepts:

* partial Message Sequence Chart (pMSC)
* projection
* Equivalent Finite State Machine (eFSM) for a projection
* Semantic causality
* Domain theory
* State value
* Identical states



## Findings

- Definition of *indeterminism* in behavior of distributed systems
- Detection of failures and removal of faults during field use of distributed systems
- Partially Automating the specification and design review of the distributed system and detect a subset of unwanted run time behaviors, including implied behaviors.

## Suggested Future Work

* Incorporating the sequence diagram notation in requirement validation methodologies
* Extending the application to work with different UML development platforms such as IBM Rational Rose
* Implementing the proposed algorithm as a syntax checker to provide an automated tool
  to check and correct system designs
* Being extended to verify the design of multi-agent systems
* Devising algorithms to analyze design artifacts of other Agent Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) methodologies such as GAIA.
