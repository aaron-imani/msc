## Research Questions

- Which RE practices have found their way into the industry?
- Which RE practices seem to work well?
- Which RE practices seem to work badly?
- Which RE practices are “hot topics”?
- Which practices have not found their
way into industry yet?
## Brief Summary

Practices-based process improvement is based on a set of best practices instead of complex reference processes that have to be tailored to the specific needs of an organization. Therefore, during the assessment, the performed activities, their weaknesses, and possible improvements can be easily discussed and analyzed based only on a visualized set of best practices. Experiences have shown that changes can be identified and introduced with less effort based on such an approach.

The ReqMan approach provides a set of 36 best practices and related techniques that have been gathered from established RE literature and other approaches such as CMMI or SPICE, and, that have then been evaluated by industrial and scientific RE experts during the last years.

They applied their ReqMan RE process improvement approach in eight different case studies with international small and medium sized enterprises. All application cases were focused on real-life projects, developing products for customers.

Within the case studies, we applied the ReqMan
framework as follows:

- **Analysis of the current situation**
- **Identification of required practices**
- **Identification of required techniques**
- **Analysis and Results**
  - **Analysis**
  - **Interpretation**

The following questions are answered as a result of their analysis.

### Which RE practices have found their way into the industry?
- Elicitation Phase: “identify stakeholder”, “elicit goals”, “elicit tasks and business processes”, and “elicit functional requirements”
- Specification Phase: “document customer requirements”, “document developer requirements”, and “use standards and document structures”
- Validation Phase: “review requirements” and “validate usability”
- Requirements management Phase: “product planning”, “choose technology”, “manage requirements changes”, and “prioritize and negotiate requirements”

### Which RE practices seem to work well?
Only “model user behavior”, “view based documentation”, “model domain”, “prototyping”, “determine scope” and “determine feasibility” have been assessed “well done” by the case study companies.

### Which RE practices seem to work badly?
- Elicitation Phase: “elicit functional requirements” and “elicit nonfunctional requirements”
- Specification Phase: “document developers requirements”, “assure traceability”, and “describe requirements measurable and testable”
- Validation Phase: “prepare tests for requirements”, “review requirements , and “validate usability”
- Requirements management Phase: “manage variability”, “reuse requirements”, and “requirements impact analysis” 

### Which RE practices are “hot topics”?
“elicit functional requirements”, “elicit nonfunctional requirements”, “review requirements”, and “document developer requirements”.

### Which practices have not found their way into industry yet?
“formal modeling”, “formal verification”, “reuse requirements”, “manage
variability”, “model user behavior” and “view based documentation”.

## Findings

- Presents lessons learned from several RE process improvement case studies with SME's applying the Fraunhofer IESE ReqMan approach of best racticeoriented RE process improvement. 
- Illustrate the current situation we encountered in industrial RE application and present some implications for requirements engineering researchers about the “hot topics” for RE practitioners.

## Suggested Future Work

None.

## Relevance to my work

I want to use this paper in the literature review of my summer course.
