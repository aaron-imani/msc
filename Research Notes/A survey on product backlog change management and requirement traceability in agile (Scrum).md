## Research Questions

- How are product backlog changes managed by practitioners in Scrum projects? 
- How do practitioners perceive the use of requirement traceability for product backlog and project risk management during requirement volatility in Scrum?

## Brief Summary

We developed a structured questionnaire consisting of 22 questions grouped into four sections. We obtained 102 completed and submitted questionnaires, with a 64.5% response rate. Out of 102 responses, 89 were selected as they had been sent on time, and the answers were complete. 

We concluded the outcomes based on the survey results. The main reasons for requirement changes are defect fixing, missing requirements, and functionality enhancement.  As requirement changes, most practitioners write updated requirements as new requirements (56.2%). This tendency shows that instead of managing existing requirements and recording change reason or change motivation, practitioners only report them as a new requirement and develop a new sprint. This practice solves the immediate problem, but it does not support project management activities. Owing to this practice, code refactoring and other software quality issues arise.

Product backlog versions are not maintained by most practitioners (62.9%). According to practitioners, they modify existing product backlog as requirement changes. Only 28.1 % of practitioners make a new version of product backlog as change occurs on the requirement. The majority of practitioners agree on the benefits of requirement traceability, stakeholder satisfaction, and project complexity control. Practitioners perceive that historical data gathering of the requirements using requirement traceability can be helpful for the smooth flow of a project and can provide basis for predicting product backlog change.

## Findings

- Most of the time-changed requirements in Scrum projects are recorded as a new
requirement, and no change history is maintained. 
- Product backlog is saved immediately as requirement changes, and no change record is maintained for product backlog.
- Requirement traceability is considered an acceptable practice that can be used for a smooth project development and product backlog change prediction given a complete requirement history record.

## Suggested Future Work

- Requirement traceability method for Scrum projects
- Using requirement traceability and Scrum artifacts to develop a framework for product backlog change prediction

## Relevance to my work

I want to use this paper in the literature review of my summer course.
