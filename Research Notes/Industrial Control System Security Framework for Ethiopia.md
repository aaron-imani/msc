## Research Questions

How to help organizations address the challenges of increased use of standard IT technologies in the industrial control system (*ICS*) environment

## Brief Summary

The paper proposes a framework to ICS security framework based on industry good practice from the fields of ICS and IT security and aims to help organizations address the challenges of increased use of standard IT technologies in the ICS environment. The ICS Security Framework consisting of its core and supporting elements is intended to be a point of reference for organizations and audiences from different areas to begin to develop and tailor the ICS security that is appropriate to its needs.

As a minimum requirement the following four key pillars of security areas should be addressed:

- Integrity
- Availability
- Confidentiality
- Non-repudiation

Moreover, the paper has suggested to use a layered security approach because of the following benefits:

- Reducing the complexity of networking
- Apply divide and control approach in maintenance and troubleshooting
- Localizing errors in case of problem occurance

The ICS network architecture includes firewalls, the use of demilitarized zones and intrusion detection capabilities throughout the ICS architecture. The use of several demilitarized zones brings us below advatanges:

- Seperate functionalities and access previleges
- Very effective in protecting large architectures comprised of networks with different operational mandates

Other security countermeasures are strongly recommended as below:

- Security Policies (should be reviewed periodically)
- Control and Filtering of Traffic (by means of firewalls, proxies, and elements intended to identify and separate traffic and communications)
- Access Control and Authentication
- Encryption of Communications
- Detecting Malicious Activity
- Mitigating Possible Attacks
- Fixing Core Problems
- Physical Security

## Findings

- A point of reference for organizations and audiences from different areas to begin to develop and tailor the ICS security that is appropriate to its needs
- Standardization of critical infrastructure by minimizing security risks

## Suggested Future Work

Detail security counter measures, privacy considerations and implementation strategies
for Ethiopia

## Relevance to my work

Helped me to understand the security aspects I should cover in the summer paper (the communication protocol that we want to propose using gRPC)
