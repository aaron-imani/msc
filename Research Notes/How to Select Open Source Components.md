## Research Questions

- What criteria should be considered while opting for an open source component for a software product?

## Brief Summary

The study have been conducted to adivse the critera to be considered while considering to inclduing an open-sourse component in a product. According to this study, examination of a candidate project should be done through two perspectives: The product and its development process. 

Regarding product, following criteria should be considered.

### Functionality
- Whether the product covers current needs and future strategic directions
- Selecting a small, focused project over a larger one has many advantages

### Licensing
- Whether the project’s is compatible with your business model, mission, or other software you are using.

### Nonfunctional properties
- Is it compatible with your product’s processor architecture, operating system, and middleware?
- Is the product’s performance compatible with your requirements?

### Popularity
- Popularity is important because it can determine how likely it will be for your questions to receive answers on public forums, for volunteers to contribute fixes and enhancements, and for the project to continue to evolve if its original developers veer off course.

### Documentation
- How well the software is documented, both at the technical (installation and main tenance procedures) and user levels
(tutorials and reference manuals).

### Source code
- If you anticipate adjusting the project to your needs, then select projects written in programming languages with which you are familiar.
- Are they named and organized into directories following the conventions of the project’s programming language? Is there
evidence of unit testing? 
- Does the re pository also contain elements that it shouldn’t, such as object and executable files?
- Are methods or functions short and readable? 
- Are identifiers well chosen?
- Is the code reasonably commented? 
- Is the formatting consistent with the language’s coding conventions?
  
Regarding process, following criteria should be considered.

### Development process
- Does the project practice continuous integration?
- Does it, for example, include static analysisof the code as well as unit testing?
- Does it build and spell-check the documentation?
- Does it calculate testing code coverage? 
- Does it enforce coding standards? 
- Does it check for up-to-date dependencies?

### Code commits
- Are commits regularly made by a diverse group of committers?
  - Commits by a single author or very few signal that the project suffers from a key person risk AKA a *bus factor*.
- Look at the details of a few commits. 
  - Are they clearly labeled and appropriately described?
  - Do they reference any documented issues that they have addressed using a standard convention? 
  - Is there evidencethat code changes and additions have been reviewed and discussed?

### Project releases
- Are these sufficiently recent and frequent?
- In some cases, frequently integrating new releases of an open source component into your code base can be disruptive, due to the risks and additional work of this process.
  - Check for a separate release channel for obtaining only security and other critical fixes.
- If there are longterm support releases and determine whether their time horizon matches your project’s pace.

### Support channels
- Is there an online forum, a mailing list, or a chat group where you can ask questions?
- Do useful answers arrive quickly? 
- Are respondents supportive and friendly?
- Examine the quality of paid support options offered through specialized companies, consultants, or products.

### Handling issues
- Are issues resolved quickly? 
- How many issues have been left rotting open for ages? 
- Does the ratio between open and closed issues appear to be under control, that is, in line with the number of project contributors?

### Contributing fixes and enhancements
- How easy it is to contribute fixes and enhancements?
- Is there a contributor’s guide?
- If you’re using the project as a binary package, is it easy to build and test the project from its source code?
- Through what hoops do you have to jump to get your contribution accepted?
- Is there an efficient method by which to submit your changes, for example, through a GitHub pull request?
- Does the project regularly accept third-party contributions?
