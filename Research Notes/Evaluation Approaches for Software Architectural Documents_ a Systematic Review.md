## Research Questions

- How is software architecture or an architectural document evaluated? 
- Which are the approaches and what is the context that they are executed?

## Brief Summary

The paper has conducted a systematic literature review (*SLR*) to identify the existing software evaluation approaches, their advantages, and limitations. First, they have elaborated on the benefits of an SLR over an ad-hoc literature review. Afterwards, they have explained the process of doing an SLR and described what they have done for each of the steps.

They have identified 20 studies concerning a software evaluation approach. Out of the 20 studies, 11 of them were questioning based methods. 5 out of 20 studies were based on measuring and the rest of studies were hybrid. The authors have analyzed all the evaluation approaches. They have compared the methodologies by subjectivity, Execution cost, Number of quality requirements, and Limited application context as below:

- The lack of experimental studies
- The existence of bibliographical reviews that also aimed to identify architectural evaluation approaches
- The number of architectural evaluation methods that the systematic review was able to identify when compared to the other reviews which was, on average, 8 methods.
- These methodologies evaluate the architectures against a restrict number of qualities attributes
- The evaluation approaches  are based on their own and specific documentation architecture approaches, what makes it difficult to apply in different project or contexts

A checklist based software evaluation approach has been proposed by the authors called the inspection approach which is  composed by a configurable checklist that evaluates the suitability of the architecture model, described by means of an architectural document, regarding the specified quality requirements.

## Findings

-  A more complete identification of evaluation methods and its characterization
-  The proposal of a software evaluation approach (the inspection approach)

## Suggested Future Work

- The proposed software evaluation approach is going to be evaluated by two experimental studies. 
  
## Relevance to my work

This paper has conducted a systematic literature review of the research on software evaluation methodologies which is useful in my thesis and first paper literature review when explaining our evaluation method.
