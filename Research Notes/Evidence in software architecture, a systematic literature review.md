## Research Questions

- What is the state-of-the-art in empirical studies of software architecture?
- What is the strength of empirical evidence reflected in empirical software architecture literature?

## Brief Summary

They have identified and accumulated relevant literature having empirical results published between 1972 and 2010 to report the status of the field. The results from the study confirm the emergence of software architecture (SA) as a separate discipline in 90s. We reported the most actively participating institutions, geographical regions, publication channels. In our SLR we identified the mature and developing areas of SA and active domains. Below is summarized bullet points of the paper systematic literature review:

- They have reviewed 247 studies published between 1972 and 2010.
- SA Evaluation, non-functional requirements (NFR) related SA research, software architecture design and SA documentation/description are part of the core architecting process.
-  SA research community has done their most research using the application used within the computing discipline e.g. compilers, middleware, testing tools, operating systems, etc.
- Product Line, Distributed and Service Oriented Architecture are the emerging trends mostly focused by the researchers.
- The output of study refers to **propose** (50%) some tool/technique/process/language/framework/model (30%) or **usage** of some tool/technique/process/language/framework/model or its **modification** by the researchers (15%).
- Case Study is the research methodology used for most of the studies.
- Various data collection methods were used to capture the data. Interview, archive analysis and observations were most widely used data collection methods.

## Findings

-  Identified and accumulated relevant literature having empirical results published between 1972 and 2010
-  Reported the most actively participating institutions, geographical regions, publication channels
-  Identified the mature and developing areas of SA and active domains

## Suggested Future Work

To carry out detailed analysis of data extracted from identified studies and report patterns and gaps to advance the research and practice within SA discipline.
  
## Relevance to my work

It gave me an insight of trends in software architecture area. Can be used in the literature review section of my thesis.
