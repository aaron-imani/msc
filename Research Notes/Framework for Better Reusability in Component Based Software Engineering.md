## Research Questions

- How to to develop successful component based software system?

## Brief Summary

The paper proposes a framework to develop component based software. This framework helps to achieve better reusability of the component by providing ease of component selection using domain knowledge and off-the-shelf-components availability. It also helps less skilled developer to develop successful component based software system. The framework consists of four main activites as follows:

- Requirement Gathering
- Analysis & Design
  - Component Selection
- Implementation & Testing
  - Interface with Component
- Maintenance
  - Replacement

The component selection sub-activity has been explained in details and a flowchart has been provided to suppport their 

## Future work

The implementation of this framework will be done in the future to demonstrate that how this model helps in achieving the better reusability. Furthermore, it can be extended to various communication networks for better reusability and implementations such
as Wireless Sensor Networks and Internet of Things.
  
## Relevance to my work

Can be used in literature review of the second paper (and also thesis)
