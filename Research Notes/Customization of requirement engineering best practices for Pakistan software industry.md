## Research Questions

- How different software houses in Pakistan has customized the requirement engineering process according to their needs?

## Brief Summary

The questionnaire was consisting of 16 different questions, which were divided into two main sections. In the first part, we tried to get information about the background of every organization. The second section consisted of questions about the requirement engineering practices and processes followed by the organizations and how they customized it for their needs. A total of eighteen companies was included in the survey located in different cities of Pakistan.

According to the analysis of the questionnaire collected answers, there are many differences in a typical Requirement Engineering process and the process used in most of the organizations of Pakistan. Most of the changes done in the requirement process are due to a large number of offshore & freelancing projects, and there is no any proper model for dealing with such a kind of projects.

After asking about the requirement process of all the organizations, they modeled all the customized characteristics and phases of the requirement engineering which contains the customizations done by most of the organizations in the Pakistan. In most of the organizations, this model works along with the iterative, agile process. According to this model, the first of all the initial requirements are get from a customer in initial  requirements customer tells what kind of product he/she wanted to get developed for him and what are the essential features they need. 

The requirement team also asks about the deadline of the project from the client. After getting all this information, a feasibility check is performed during which estimated cost and time are calculated and documented as feasibility report. The customer is also notified of the estimated cost and time. After it, detailed requirements are gathered from the client. During this phase all functional and non-functional requirements are identified then all of these requirements and features demanded by the customer are documented to generate requirement document (Software Requirement Specification Document) which is again validated by the client. 

After approving the requirement document the final payable cost by the customer to develop product and the final deadline is told to the client if he accepts cost and time, then an agreement is signed between both development team and the client team. At last requirement document is handed over to design and coding team.

## Findings

-  A customized specification model which is followed by most of the software organizations of Pakistan.

## Suggested Future Work

None.

## Relevance to my work

I want to use this paper in the literature review of my summer course.
