## Research Questions

- To identify and analyse the work practices used in softwareintensive businesses to support the evaluation and possible adoption of OSS components in CBSE.
- To understand challenges faced by software-intensive businesses when evaluating OSS components for adoption, and how those challenges contribute to the work practices used.

## Brief Summary

The authors have reported and analysed results from a study of the experiences of managers and practitioners in six businesses in the primary and secondary software sectors in Sweden involved in the selection and evaluation of Open Source Software (OSS) components for use in products and internal tools. Based on the responses the challenges of evaluating OSS components are divided into four categories: Technical, Compliance, OSS project attributes, and risks. Below is the classification of each categories:


Technical aspects of OSS components considered by respondents during evaluation

- Feasibility
- Good-Fit
- Limited Alternatives
- Long-Term Maintenance
- Maintenance
- Maintenance In-House
- Non-Trivial
- Requirements
- Safety-Critical
- Security
- Software Adaptation
- Standards
- Time-Saver

OSS licence considerations during component evaluation:

- Compatibility
- Revision
- Obligations

OSS project attributes considered during evaluation:

- Active Development
- Active Support
- Community Activity
- Documentation
- Project Structure
- Support Options
- Supported Project
- Wide Use

Risks assessed by respondents during OSS component evaluation:

- Commercial Terms
- Dynamic
- Financial
- Lock-in
- Maintenance
- Obsolescence
- Project Supported
- Reputation
- Security
- Skills
  
## Suggested Future Work

- The type and extent of vigilance needed by a business to evaluate an adopted soft ware component continuously.
- How vigilant does a company need to be in order to protect itself from potentially detrimental changes within the OSS project or software? And, what form should that vigilance take?
  
## Relevance to my work

Can be used in literature review of the second paper (and also thesis)
