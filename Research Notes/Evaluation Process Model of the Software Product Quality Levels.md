## Research Questions

How to objectively evaluate the quality of the delivered software products

## Brief Summary

The paper has proposed a process model for evaluating the level of software product quality, which is based on the International Standard *ISO/IEC 14598 - Software Product Evaluation*. 

The proposed evaluation process model consists of multiple processes. Each process is a set of activities and each activity is comprised of some tasks. Below is the structure of the process model:

- Process 1: Establish Evaluation Requirements
  - Activity 1.1 – Establish Purpose of Evaluation
    - Task 1.1.1 Understand Environment and Characteristics of Software
    - Task 1.1.2 Confirm Purpose of Evaluation of Software Product Quality
  - Activity 1.2 ̢ Identify Types of Product
    - Task 1.2.1 – Specify and Confirm Type of Product
  - Activity 1.3 - Specify Quality Model
    - Task 1.3.1 – Specify and Confirm Quality Model
- Process 2˖ Specify the Evaluation
  - Activity 2.1 - Select Metrics
    - Tasks 2.1.1 - Select and Confirm Metrics
  - Activity 2.2 - Establish Rating Levels for Metrics
    - Task 2.2.1 - Confirm Rating Levels for Metrics
    - Task 2.2.2 - Confirm Target or Range Value of Metrics
  - Activity 2.3 - Establish Criteria for Evaluation
    - Task 2.3.1 - Confirm Evaluation Model for Level of Software Product Quality
    - Task 2.3.2 - Confirm Promise for Level of Software Product Quality
- Process 3: Design the Evaluation
  - Activity 3.1 Prepare Evaluation Plan
    - Task 3.1.1 Confirm Evaluation Plan
- Process 4: Execute the Evaluation
  - Activity 4.1 Collect Measures
    - Task 4.1.1 Collect Measures
  - Activity 4.2 Compare with Criteria
    - Task 4.2.1 Confirm if Quality Attributes of Products has been satisfied or not
    - Tasks 4.2.2 Confirm Level of Software Product Quality
  - Activity 4.3 Assess Results
    - Tasks 4.3.1 Confirm Level of Software Product Quality is in compliance with the promise or not


## Findings

- Strengthen the mechanism of software product quality measurement and analysis
- Enhance the motivation and willingness of software quality assurance
-  Helps software development organizations establish their own evaluation models of the software product quality level 
-  Helps software organizations objectively evaluate if the delivered software product meets the quality requirement of customers
-  Serves as an agreement of the requirement of software product quality

## Suggested Future Work

None

## Relevance to my work

I studied this paper to get some ideas about software quality assessment as the evaluation part of the summer paper
