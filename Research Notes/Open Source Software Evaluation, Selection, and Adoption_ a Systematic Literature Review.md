## Research Questions

- What OSS evaluation, selection, and adoption models have been proposed so far?
- What are the common factors that are considered in the selection, evaluation, and adoption process?

## Brief Summary

They have conducted a systematic literature review to answer their research questions. They found 262 studies published until the end of 2019. They selected 60 primary studies: 20 surveys and 5 lessons learned studies elicited the motivations for OSS adoption; 35 papers proposed several OSS evaluation models focusing on different technical aspects. The result of this work could be highly beneficial for OSS producers, since they could check if they are providing all the information commonly required by who is evaluating their products, and maximize the likelihood of being selected. It could also be useful for practitioners that need to evaluate an OSS product. The list of factors can be effectively used as checklist to verify if all the potentially important characteristics of OSS have been duly evaluated.

## Findings

- Identified a set of 262 studies addressing OSS selection models
- Extracted a set of factors, measures, and information that characterize the analyzed models
- A synthesis of the evolution and the current motivation for OSS adoption
- A synthesis of the existing OSS adoption and evaluation models.

## Suggested Future Work

- Focus on the definition of a common model (which may be obtained by merging multiple available approaches) and favor its adoption through rigorous and extensive validation in industrial settings.
- Try to target the models at quality factors that are of real interest for stakeholders.
- Develop tools that support the research directions listed above (i.e., tools able to support and simplify the applicability of the proposed models during the evaluation of OSS products). 

## Relevance to my work

I want to use this paper in the literature review of my summer paper.
