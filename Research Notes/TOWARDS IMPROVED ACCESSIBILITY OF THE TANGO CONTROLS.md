## Research Questions

- What are the projects and activities to support collaboration and make Tango Controls easier to start with?
- What is the status of such projects and activities?
- What is the impact of these projects and activities on the Tango Controls collaboration?

## Brief Summary

The Tango Community raised several projects and activities to support collaboration as well as to make Tango Controls being easier to start with. Some of the projects are led by S2Innovation. These projects are: 

- **Gathering and unifying of Tango Controls documentation:**  In order to encourage contributions the idea was to write documentation like code. It was then decided to use Sphinx and to convert and publish all the tango-controls related
documentation on *readthedocs*.
- **Preparation of a so-called TangoBox virtual machine:** The TangoBox comes with pre-installed Tango core libraries and tools, including various desktop and web applications. These are available as launchers, directly from its desktop. The goals are:

  - Providing a way to use the ecosystem without the need to spend time on investigation, selection and configuration of most of Tango Controls tools
  - Providing a working configuration example
  - Being used by developers for building and testing new software.


- **Providing a device classes catalogue:**  promotes open-source software, endorses software reuse and prevents duplication of work. The *import script* and Continuous Integration services facilitate the process of publication new classes to the catalogue.

## Findings

The development, usage and maintenance of the documentation, TangoBox and Device Classes catalogue facilitate
collaboration within the Community

## Suggested Future Work

None

## Relevance to my work

I want to use this paper in the literature review of my summer paper.
