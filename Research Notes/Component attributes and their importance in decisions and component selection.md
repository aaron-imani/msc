## Research Questions

- What matters the most to industry practitioners when selecting CSOs?
- Is the decision process regarding the CSO affected by the practitionersâ€™ known characteristics (i.e., role, working experience and education)?

## Brief Summary

The study has conducted a survey with 157 participants to select up to 4 componenet selection options (CSO) from the below options:

- Software developed internally (in-house)
- Software developed outsourced
- Commercial of the shelf software
- Open-source software

The participants were asked to choose based on scoring 12 components attributes with a grade between 0 and 100, summing up to 100. The results show that practitioners with different roles, academic background, the maturity of the product they have been working on, and size of the company had different priorities in scoring the attributes. The most important attribute was "cost" among the majority of the participants.

## Findings

-  Understanding of the CSO decision and selection.
-  A comparison of the different supported back-ends
  
## Suggested Future Work

- Providing support to companies in improving their component selection process
- Continue research and efforts towards efficient and effective decision making in component-based software engineering
  
## Relevance to my work

Can be used in literature review of the second paper (and also thesis)
