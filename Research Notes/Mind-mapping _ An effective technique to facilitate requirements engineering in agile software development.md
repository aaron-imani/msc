## Research Questions

- Can mind-mapping lead to the development of a suitable product backlog? How?

## Brief Summary

Nowadays, mind-mapping has built up a reputation for being a cognitive tool exploiting the full potential of information processing by involving both the human brain's hemispheres. The basic technique is to take a plain white sheet, write the title of the subject in the middle of the page, and draw a circle around it. Lines from the circles can be drawn, and subdivisions or subheadings are then added. These subheadings can be circled in turn, and newlines, subheadings, and so on can be further derived.

They took advantage of developing a digital library for deriving a case study around which to design a very simple two-conditions experiment: whether the quality of requirements represented as a backlog product in SCRUM could be affected by the adoption of mind-mapping techniques during their elicitation and analysis process.

They seperated groups of stakeholders based on how they deal with the requirements. Afterwards, they divided the groups into two groups. The first group didn't receive any instructions regarding mind-mapping technique, but the second group learned about mind-mapping technique in a seminar.

The data we obtained show that, when mind mapping is adopted, the overall quality of the product backlog (measured against the "function points" metric) is significantly higher with "less expert" product owners, and at least not worst with more expert product owners, than when the product backlog is the mere outcome of an informal requirements engineering approach. It can also be concluded that mind-mapping and any derived technique should be considered as a valuable good practice to be pursued for setting up of a proper initial product backlog.

## Findings

- The impact of mind-mapping in requirements elicitation for a proper initial product backlog in agile development methods. 

## Suggested Future Work

None

## Relevance to my work

I want to use this paper in the literature review of my summer course.
