## Research Questions

- Why is it important to measure maintainability?
- What are the best ways to measure maintainability?

## Brief Summary

### Why is it important to measure maintainability?
- Deciding whether and what parts of existing software to
reuse;
- Deciding whether to maintain or redevelop software components;
- Estimating the amount of effort involved in maintaining
software components;
- Determining award fees, acceptance criteria for Turnkey
software;
- Providing evaluation data for reuse repositories;
- Saving a significant fraction of total software ownership
costs
### Popular ways to measure maintainability
- **Maintainability Index (MI):** Higher MI indicates higher code maintainability, which suggests that the code is easier to understand and maintainers should be able to easily find and fix bugs, make changes, or add new features.
- **Technical debt:** A metaphor that has been widely-used in academia and industry to explain the consequences of making non-optimal software development decisions on a project.
- **Code smells**
- **Object-Oriented metrics** such as weighted methods per class, lack of cohesion in methods, coupling between objects, decoupling level, and so on.
- **CO**nstructive **CO**st **MO**del II (COCOMO II)
### What are the best ways to measure maintainability?
It appears that technical debt, Maintainability Index, and COCOMO II can be synergetic in estimating relative maintainability effort, and in identifying key parts of the software most needing maintainability improvement, rather than trying to pick a best single approach.
## Findings

The best ways to measure maintainability

## Suggested Future Work

- Include a larger number of OSS projects, as well as closed source projects such as UCC Code Count and extensive data from USC-neighborhood software applications developed in their MS-level team project course, other complexity metrics such as Chidamber-Kemerer, code, smells, and readability such as specific language coding styles and developersâ€™ experience
and expertise. 
- Increasing the number of experimental maintainers
- Recruiting maintainer subjects with different skills and experience levels. 
- Investigate other software metrics such as number of bugs, modularity and information hiding.

## Relevance to my work

Got ideas about how to compare software maintainability of our proposed toolkit with Tango Controls
