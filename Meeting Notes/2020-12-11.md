## Research
Mike and Dave elaborated on the overview of the ARTTA4 project and Mike is going to send some documentations to get more detailed information about the project. 
According to the presented overview by Mike, I have the following general ideas about the possible areas we can conduct research:
- As the system is real-time and messages/signals should be delivered within a speciic deadline and the executer part had a single queue of commands, a possible area would be prioritizing real-time queues to meet message deadlines.
- Another suggested area that could be worked on is the consistency of messages among the flow of information in software system
- Risk analysis in distributed systems
