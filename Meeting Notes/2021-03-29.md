## Software Development

- Had a meeting last week on Tuesday, and they suggested some changes to the facilitator's side.

## Research

We discussed the protocol proposed by "[MDNS Based Automatic Discovery Method In Optical NMS](../Research%20Notes/MDNS%20Based%20Automatic%20Discovery%20Method%20In%20Optical%20NMS.md)" paper that can help reach some ideas for both thesis and the summer paper. Moreover, we discussed my initial idea about the [summer paper](https://uofc-my.sharepoint.com/:o:/g/personal/alireza_imani_ucalgary_ca/EnaNVE2s8vNMhQZv9Qy7jIMBnjIIuHiP1yFbhCUqzKmF3w?e=yJgc5A) that is an On-demand device discovery protocol for software control systems. 

Dr. Moshirpour suggested first finding similar solutions for this problem. Then, try to use design patterns like publish and subscribe, service discovery, peer-to-peer architecture, etc., to solve the problem. We should also decide on the software quality criteria we want to satisfy using our proposed methodology.
