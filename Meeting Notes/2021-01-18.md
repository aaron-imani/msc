## Software Development
Designed 3 layouts of ATTACH parent's app and shared it with Amy to see whether I should continue with the current design. She approved it  and I will continue designing next layouts.
## Research
I have started reading [Evolution in Domain Model-Based Requirements Engineering for Control Systems Development](https://github.com/alirezaimn/msc/issues/26) and I will present it when I finish studying it. Dr. Moshirpour told me to think about the ideas on which we can publish a paper with Amy. It can be something like The process of gathering requirements in security-critical software systems or requirement elicitation process from domain experts of the software system.
