# Session 14
*Monday, March 15th, 2021*

## Attendees

- Dr. Moshirpour
- Alireza Imani

## General Updates

- Recommended my talented friend, Soroush Hosseinpour as a strong applicant
- Talked to Mike about my thesis, and I found out that Tango hasn't covered security aspects of control systems properly

## Software Development

- Received Jason's notes about the comments on the facilitator's side
- I'm going to apply the changes and present them on next Tuesday

## Research

Studied a paper about the principles of SCADA-system development; research notes of which is available [here](https://github.com/alirezaimn/msc/blob/main/Research%20Notes/Principles%20of%20SCADA-system%20development.md). Moreover, we discussed partially "eTDP: Enhanced Topology Discovery Protocol for Software-Defined Networks" that can be helpful to reach some ideas for both thesis and the summer paper.
The potential idea for the summer paper is "Auto-discovery devices in RPC-based software control systems".
