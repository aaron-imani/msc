## Software Development

Finished up wireframing the parents’ side of the ATTACH project and continuing with writing requirements.

## Research

Presented the second half of [The Way it Makes you Feel Predicting Users’ Engagement during Interviews with Biofeedback and Supervised Learning](https://github.com/alirezaimn/msc/issues/27) to Dr. Moshirpour and discussed about an idea on which we can publish a paper.  

Considering the ATTACH project, we have a project with varietes of non-technical stakeholders. In such cases, *uncertainty* can affect elicitated software requirements. We can conduct a research to analyse the stakeholders’ biofeedback in addition to vocal signal and facial gestures analysis during requirements elicitation sessions to detect requirements on which some stakeholders doubt, so that  software engineers won't try implementing uncertain requirements. We can possibly classify the requirements based on the certainty of them and that way we can organize product backlog in agile methodologies.
